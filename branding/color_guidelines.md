# SoundCrowd Brand Guidelines
<hr>


## Brand Overview
SoundCrowd is a dynamic music collaboration platform that enables creators to share and request song stems, fostering a community of musical co-creation. Our brand identity reflects the collaborative, innovative, and harmonious nature of our platform.

## Logo
Our logo combines two semicircular elements that form an abstract 'S', representing the duality of "creation" and "collaboration". The word mark "SoundCrowd" appears in a clean, modern typeface that emphasizes clarity and professionalism.
## Brand Identity
- Logotype Font is "Perfectly Vintages", by Keitzo (7NTypes)

### Logo Usage
- Maintain clear space around the logotype equal to the height of the 'S' in SoundCrowd
- Minimum size: 24px height for digital applications
- Do not stretch, distort, or alter the logo's proportions
- Do not add drop shadows, outlines, bevel, or embossing to the logotype or logo
- Do not change the logo's colors outside the use cases described below without express approval: 
  - Preferred primary logo usage is on white or light backgrounds
  - For dark backgrounds, preferred logo is "SC Monochrome Light"
  - For light, monochrome use cases preferred logo is "SC Monochrome Dark"
- Logo usage should be sparing and meaningful. Less is more!

### Merchandise and Other Content
- When possible, the "SoundCrowd" logotype and logo should never be seperated
- The "SoundCrowd" logotype and logo should never be on different lines / planes.
  - If the logotype and logo cannot be displayed together, priority should be given to the logotype.
